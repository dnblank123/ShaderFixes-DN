# Working
AMD CPU fix works on all settings
</br>

# TODO
~~[Particle] Check the list of values for precision rather (v4 <= n) so that others particle aren't affected.~~
</br>

# Changes
There will be changes to the vertex or how it appears on the screen if you use this, for example, shadows and particles. This also added a fix to AMD CPU particle alignment on a shader level.
</br>

# Limitation
~~Other fixes only works on low settings.~~
